*** Raw data used for the study

~R-ML-and-StackOverflow-psql.xz-part00~ to ~R-ML-and-StackOverflow-psql.xz-part05~ This is a partitioned SQL dump (postgresql) of the *raw data* used for the study. The file was compressed using xz and split (due to github restrictions regarding file size). To re-create the database run the following: (using Linux)

#+begin_src 
cat R-ML-and-StackOverflow-psql.xz-part* | xzcat | pgsql template1
#+end_src

This will create a database called ~MLandSOF~  Under Windows, first concatenate the files (in order, -part00 to -part05), then decompress. The decompressed file is a SQL script that can be read by pgsql.
 

*** Coded sample data

~R-ML-and-StackOverflow-psql-sample.tar.xz~ This is an SQL database dump (postgresql) of the emails and Stackoverflow posts that were analyzed and coded as part of the study (referred to as the *sample data*). The file was compressed using xz. To create the database run the following: (using Linux)

#+begin_src 
cat R-ML-and-StackOverflow-psql-sample.tar.xz | xzcat > r_ml_so.dump
#+end_src

And then load the dump using [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/app-pgrestore.html][pg_restore]]:

#+begin_src 
pg_restore -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d sampledb -v "r_ml_so.dump"
#+end_src
